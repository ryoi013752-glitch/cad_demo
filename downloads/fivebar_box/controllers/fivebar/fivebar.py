"""fivebar controller."""

# You may need to import some classes of the controller module. Ex:
#  from controller import Robot, Motor, DistanceSensor
from controller import Robot
import math

# create the Robot instance.
robot = Robot()

# get the time step of the current world.
timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

# You should insert a getDevice-like function in order to get the
# instance of a device of the robot. Something like:
joint1 = robot.getDevice('joint1')
#  ds = robot.getDevice('dsname')
#  ds.enable(timestep)

# Main loop:
# - perform simulation steps until Webots is stopping the controller
while robot.step(timestep) != -1:
    # Read the sensors:
    # Enter here functions to read sensor data, like:
    #  val = ds.getValue()

    # Process sensor data here.

    # Enter here functions to send actuator commands, like:
    # case one
    # rotate 90 degree
    #joint1.setPosition(math.pi/2)
    # case two
    # set rotation velocity
    joint1.setPosition(float('inf'))
    joint1.setVelocity(1.0)
    pass

# Enter here exit cleanup code.
